# EarlyFloodDetection
The goal of our project is to develop an early flood detection system using the Internet of Things (IoT) and a variety of sensors. Floods are one of the most common and destructive natural disasters, causing significant loss of life and property damage. By using the power of IoT, we aim to create a system that can accurately predict the likelihood of a flood and alert relevant parties in time to take preventive measures.
The system will be based on the Arduino Uno microcontroller and the ESP8266 Wi-Fi module. The Arduino Uno will serve as the central control unit, responsible for collecting data from the various sensors and sending it to the server. The ESP8266 will enable the system to connect to the internet, allowing the collected data to be transmitted and analysed in real-time.
We will use several types of sensors to monitor different aspects of the environment. The HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor will be used to measure water levels, while the DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor will provide data on atmospheric conditions. Additionally, we will use a water flow sensor to measure the flow rate of water, and a water level sensor to monitor changes in the water level over time.
Once the data has been collected, it will be sent to a central server for analysis. The server will use machine learning algorithms to analyse the data and determine the likelihood of a flood. If a flood is deemed to be imminent, the system will issue alerts to relevant parties, such as local authorities and residents in at-risk areas. These alerts will provide valuable time for individuals and organizations to take preventive measures, such as evacuating the area or moving valuable possessions to higher ground.
